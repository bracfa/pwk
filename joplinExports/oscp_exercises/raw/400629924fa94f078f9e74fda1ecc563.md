# 18.2.3.2
## 18.2.3.2.1. Log in to your Windows client as the admin user and attempt to bypass UAC using the application and technique covered above.

Search for the location of fodhelper.exe. We will choose the one in c:\windows\system32
`dir fodhelper.exe /s`
![ede6d896bbe57dccdbd731d604e443ca.png](:/1d794b18a4b34d2d9ba2f1300a9d3043)

Run fodhelper.exe
`c:\windows\system32\fodhelper.exe`
![d9fc2c5c77871c9b01d9fc7dab507a7a.png](:/cc0bf58558ea47d485a5c48a1bbb62ad)

Inspect fodhelper.exe's application manifest. The applicatipn manifest is an XML file containing info that lets the operating system know how to handle the program when it is start. We will use the sigcheck utility from Sysinternals for this task.
`c:\Tools\privilege_escalation\SysinternalsSuite>sigcheck.exe -a -m C:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe` 
![5d96ca07e7883ef299d257e5610274c7.png](:/2a11440045fc430da100ec1973771f28)

Take note of the <requestedPrivileges> and <autoElevate> code blocks in the application manifest. We see that fodhelper is meant to be run by administrative users, and therefore requires the full administrator access token. The autoelevate flat is set to true, which allows the executable to auto-elevate to high integrity without prompting the administrator user for consent.

Next we use Process Monitor from Sysintenals suite to gather info about fodhelper.exe as it executes. 
Search for procmon.exe
`c:\>dir procmon.exe /s`
![6b5b984ddfe4e7b342e2c7319f32df2f.png](:/4a1137acf0d64273a16fadd6579fcfae)

Run procmon.exe
`c:\>c:\Tools\privilege_escalation\SysinternalsSuite\Procmon.exe`
![497009c9d0a1322a484ba16484383050.png](:/6c8bf73d47b343a1bede6ba052dfa37a)

Run fodhelper.exe
`c:\>c:\Windows\System32\fodhelper.exe`

Go to Process Monitor -> Filter -> Process Name is fodhelper.exe then Include -> Add -> Apply -> OK
![40990b2a6c3edef405df21263522b8c2.png](:/43e49395c8d84c029b921967233eb78c)

Then we add another filter.
Proess Monitor -> Filter -> Operation contains Reg then Include -> Add -> Apply -> OK.

Now let's look at the Process Monitor output as a result of our two filters
![bb43176d0fb3f24c745d49afe8fa83a7.png](:/5cb7d1161f3d479cac9827b3ca693eb9)

We still need to narrow our search for registry entries that do not exist. Specifically we want to see if the fodhelper application is attempting to access registry entries that do not exist. 

Let's put a filter -> Result is NAME NOT FOUND then Include -> Add -> OK
![a636cfed5c6c2141b778d15fd568d945.png](:/17a6dded06ba4158999628cd34c28dff)

Review the results of our now 3 filters
![50caa902e0f4eb0c5491eb82e5ac9414.png](:/e88f6f1ab72f4a3ba19d48f70529e440)

Look for a registry hive that we can control such as *HKEY_CURRENT_USER** *(HKCU)* hive which we, as the current user, have read and write access to:

Process Monitor Filter -> Path contains HKCU then Include -> Add -> OK.
![51f32044d3130485e081f7b526395ca2.png](:/1a1a6a81ad1f45838cb11582be436c12)

View the results of the 4 filters
![865dad11c5e13c6ecc6399d13ff60f6c.png](:/81ad0079dfab48479ecee61330b1889d)

We find an interesting one at **HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command**. fodhelper.exe queries this registry but it does not appear to exist.
![bd23d042755c5c1edf003f1bcd8eae0e.png](:/72074cc6b45e4d2c8175d2e40f40eb87)

Let's add another filter.
Process Monitor Filter -> Path contains ms-settings\shell\open\command then Include -> Add -> OK
![fba5de670caa63a3246b39f6d0ca9b87.png](:/d76e9c8fc0af453a823b65cfdd5d2fef)

If the process can successully access the **ms-settings\shell\open\command** key in some other hive, the results will provide us with more clues. Let's remove the filter for NAME NOT FOUND, because we want to also see SUCCESS
![362a939c9252bfc0f9ddd0129b63016c.png](:/648ec30c0f9a40d2a1972bd21c0f3e02)

The filter now looks like this
![9eae284dd4646bb0eb890f622183d5fd.png](:/d669e105d5244567b3b61e481f88f28b)

We see another interesting result. When fodhelper does not find the ms-settings\shell\open\command registry key in HKCU, it immediately tries to access the same key in the **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** *(HKCR)* hive. Because this hive exists, the acess is successful.
![9524701966327d5fa713ad712f155b7a.png](:/cdc31c7d8c074b14ba35347f6ab1dd6b)

Open the regedit app so we can search for **HKCR:ms-settings\shell\open\command** in the registry. We can type in the path. We do find a valid entry. `Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-settings\Shell\Open\Command`
![a21536813b03f72e9187f0afd955158d.png](:/ad8f7e508d3a4d22956af809f0190682)

We can infer that fodhelper is opening a section of the Windows Settings application throught the ms-settings: application protocol. This is definitely interesting because fodhelper tries to access the ms-setting registry key within the HKCU hive first. Previous results from Process Monitor clearly showed that this key does not exist in HKCU, but we should have the necessary permissions to create it. This could allow us to hijack the execution through a properly formatted protocol handler. Let’s try to add this key with the REG utility:
`C:\Users\admin>REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command`
![754ef2a9405460f8dbd630278fc5210f.png](:/4881acc35c6c4dd19e6b7b9742384057)

Clear the results from process monitor using the 'Clear' icon
![a200ed750ba6f91f7b250f9a6810beb4.png](:/053bbd1c1b5c46228596bff77273617a)

Restart fodhelper.exe and monitor the process activity.
![f2c6220199023f42c9bfe1ce8f046676.png](:/3a56d37d4b4b462b91810b0697b790e4)

The figure above shows that, this time, fodhelper.exe attempts to query a value (DelegateExecute) stored in our newly-created command key. This did not happen before we created our fake application protocol key. However, since we do not want to hijack the execution through a COM object, we’ll add a DelegateExecute entry, leaving its value empty. Our hope is that when fodhelper discovers this empty value, it will follow the MSDN specifications for application protocols and will look for a program to launch specified in the Shell\Open\command\Default key entry.

We will use **REG ADD** with the **/v** argument to specify the value name and **/t** to specify the type:
`REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /v DelegateExecute /t REG_SZ`
![b98b6a78dac192cfaf5db17ce38d9989.png](:/788c27863e734e8eb480c3ce920a9ee3)

In order to verify that fodhelper successfully accesses the DelegateExecute entry we have just added, we will remove the “NAME NOT FOUND” filter and replace it with “SUCCESS” to show only successful operations and restart the process again:
![c17764d6a6a84027ef1d039f9bd81d65.png](:/5aaf560c679146629c694a03637208ad)
![736235db6521fd922d4a1768712b6342.png](:/f5d19b8a66ca4cb9afa0e05b63fc2f37)

As expected, fodhelper finds the new DelegateExecute entry we added, but since its value is empty, it also looks for the (Default) entry value of the Shell\open\command registry key. The (Default) entry value is created as null automatically when adding any registry key. We will follow the
application protocol specifications and replace the empty (Default) value with an executable of our choice, `cmd.exe`. This should force fodhelper to handle the ms-settings: protocol with our own executable.

In order to test this theory, we’ll set our new registry value. We’ll also specify the new registry value with /d “cmd.exe” and /f to add the value silently.
`REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command /d "cmd.exe" /f`
![431267138afb0fbcc98c02e4fefa3b39.png](:/eddb0fa3a60b44bc96871143db241fc9)

Clear the Process and Monitor and start fodhelper.exe again.

A command prompt pops-up. Let's check to see our groups. We are in a high-integrity command shell
`whoami /groups`

Attempt again to change the admin password to see if we can successfully bypass the UAC
