# 20.1.1.1.1.

## 20.1.1.1.1. Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client and run the **clear_rules.sh** sript from **/root/port_forwarding_and_tunneling** as root.

SSH into the Debian client as root and run clear_rules.sh
```
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ ssh root@192.168.214.44

## 20.1.1.1.2. Attempt to replicate the port-forwarding technique covered in the above scenario.

### Validate that our Kali machine can access the internet
Using ping
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ ping google.com -4 -c 1
PING google.com (142.250.73.238) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from iad30s36-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.73.238): icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=18.3 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 18.287/18.287/18.287/0.000 ms
```
Using netcat
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ nc -nvv 172.217.15.78 80
(UNKNOWN) [172.217.15.78] 80 (http) open
GET /
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Sun, 04 Oct 2020 14:21:29 GMT
Expires: -1
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
...
```

### Check if the Linux (Debian) client has internet access. It does not.
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ nc -nvv 172.217.15.78 80
(UNKNOWN) [172.217.15.78] 80 (http) : Connection timed out
 sent 0, rcvd 0
```

### Edit the rinetd.conf file by adding a forwarding rule..

Adding the following forwarding rule: `0.0.0.0 80 172.217.15.78 80` means that our Kali server is listening on all interfaces, and all traffic received on port Kali server's port 80 will be redirected to Google's site (172.217.15.78:80)

```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ cat /etc/rinetd.conf
#
# this is the configuration file for rinetd, the internet redirection server
#
# you may specify global allow and deny rules here
# only ip addresses are matched, hostnames cannot be specified here
# the wildcards you may use are * and ?
#
# allow 192.168.2.*
# deny 192.168.2.1?


#
# forwarding rules come here
#
# you may specify allow and deny rules after a specific forwarding rule
# to apply to only that forwarding rule
#
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport
0.0.0.0 80 172.217.15.78 80 

# logging information
logfile /var/log/rinetd.log

# uncomment the following line if you want web-server style logfile format
# logcommon
```

Restart the rinetd service
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ sudo service rinetd restart
```

Verify that the port is listening using ss (socket statistics)
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ ss -antp | grep "80"
LISTEN 0      5              0.0.0.0:80           0.0.0.0:*      
```

From the Linux (Debian) client, connect to our Kali machine via netcat. We contacted the Kali machine on port 80, which redirected traffic to the google server, and we received the google server response back on our Linux (Debian) client.
